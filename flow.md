# SaaS Digital Twin System Flow Document

Version: 1.0
Date: June 2, 2025

## 1. System Overview

This document outlines the system flow for a SaaS platform that creates AI digital twins based on users' personal Facebook data, allowing subscribers to interact conversationally with their twin.

The core function involves connecting to a user's Facebook account, securely retrieving and processing their data (posts, photos metadata, etc.), training or fine-tuning an AI model to mimic their communication style and personality, and providing an interface for the user to chat with this AI twin.

**Key Components:**

*   **Frontend (User Portal):** Web application for user sign-up, subscription management, Facebook connection, data import initiation, and the chat interface for interacting with the digital twin.
*   **Backend API Gateway/Services:** Handles user authentication, subscription logic, orchestrates data import, manages twin creation requests, and routes user interactions to the AI Twin Engine.
*   **Facebook Integration Service:** Manages OAuth flow and securely fetches data from the Facebook Graph API.
*   **Data Processing Service:** Processes raw Facebook data (text analysis, sentiment, topic modeling, extracting relevant details) into a structured format suitable for AI model training/inference.
*   **Data Storage (Database/Object Storage):** Stores processed user data, AI model parameters/states, user profiles, and subscription information.
*   **AI Training/Fine-tuning Service:** Utilizes processed data to train or fine-tune a base AI model to create a personalized digital twin. This might involve techniques like transfer learning or prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs).
*   **AI Twin Engine (Inference Service):** Hosts the trained digital twin model. Receives user input (text/audio), processes it, interacts with necessary data stores (for context), and generates a response that mimics the user's personality/style.
*   **Interaction Service:** Manages real-time conversational flow, potentially handling speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) if voice interaction is supported, and routing messages between the Frontend and the AI Twin Engine.
*   **Queueing Service (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ):** Decouples long-running tasks like data import and AI model training from immediate user requests.

## 2. User Workflows

This section describes the primary journeys a user takes through the system.

### 2.1. User Sign-Up and Subscription

1.  User accesses Frontend.
2.  User signs up (email/password or social login).
3.  User selects and purchases a subscription plan.
4.  Backend processes payment and updates user status.
5.  User gains access to the platform's features.

### 2.2. Connect Facebook & Import Data (Critical Flow)

This is a crucial step as it provides the source material for the digital twin.

    A[User] --> B{Frontend};
    B --> C[Initiate Facebook Connect];
    C --> D[Redirect to Facebook OAuth];
    D --> E[User Authorizes App on Facebook];
    E --> F[Facebook Redirects Back to Frontend with Auth Code];
    F --> G[Frontend Sends Auth Code to Backend];
    G --> H[Backend Exchanges Code for Access Token via Facebook API];
    H --> I[Backend Calls Facebook API for Data];
    I --> J[Facebook API Returns User Data (Posts, etc.)];
    J --> K[Backend Sends Data to Queueing Service];
    K --> L[Queueing Service Sends Data to Data Processing Service];
    L --> M[Data Processing Service Processes Data];
    M --> N[Data Processing Service Stores Processed Data in Data Storage];
    N --> O[Data Processing Service Notifies Backend (Processing Complete)];
    O --> P[Backend Notifies Frontend (Import Status Update)];
    P --> Q[Frontend Displays Import Status to User];

    class A,E user;
    classDef external fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;

    class C,G,K,L,M,N,O,P service;
    classDef internal fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class B,F,Q internal;

```

### 2.3. Generate Digital Twin

1.  User navigates to "Create Twin" section in Frontend.
2.  Frontend checks if enough data is imported (status from Backend).
3.  User initiates twin generation.
4.  Frontend sends request to Backend.
5.  Backend sends request to Queueing Service.
6.  Queueing Service triggers AI Training/Fine-tuning Service.
7.  AI Training Service loads processed data from Data Storage.
8.  AI Training Service trains/fine-tunes the AI model.
9.  AI Training Service stores the trained model/parameters/state in Data Storage.
10. AI Training Service notifies Backend upon completion.
11. Backend updates twin status for the user.
12. Backend notifies Frontend.
13. Frontend shows twin ready status to the user.

*(Self-correction: This flow is similar to data import in complexity but maybe less *interactive* for the user initially. The interaction flow is more critical for user experience.)*

### 2.4. Interact with Digital Twin (Critical Flow)

This is the core value proposition - the conversation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B{Frontend (Chat UI)};
    B --> C[User Input (Text/Voice)];
    C --> D[Frontend Sends Input to Backend];
    D --> E[Backend Routes Input to Interaction Service];
    E --> F{Interaction Service (STT if voice)};
    F --> G[Interaction Service Sends Text Input to AI Twin Engine];
    G --> H[AI Twin Engine Processes Input (Retrieves Context from Data Storage)];
    H --> I[AI Twin Engine Generates Text Response];
    I --> J[AI Twin Engine Sends Response to Interaction Service];
    J --> K{Interaction Service (TTS if voice, Post-processing)};
    K --> L[Interaction Service Sends Response to Backend];
    L --> M[Backend Routes Response to Frontend];
    M --> N[Frontend Displays/Plays Response to User];

```

## 3. Data Flows

This section details how information moves through the system.

### 3.1. Facebook Data Import Flow (Reframing Workflow 2.2)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Facebook Graph API] --> B{Backend};
    B --> C[Raw Data Storage (Optional)];
    B --> D[Queueing Service];
    D --> E[Data Processing Service];
    E --> F[Processed Data Storage (Database)];
    F --> G[AI Training/Fine-tuning Service];
    G --> F; %% AI Models/State stored
    F --> H[AI Twin Engine]; %% Data for context/retrieval
    H --> H; %% Internal state management

    %% Data Types on Edges
    B -- Access Token --> A;
    A -- Raw User Data (Posts, Comments, Reactions, Photos Metadata) --> B;
    B -- Raw User Data --> C;
    B -- Raw User Data Reference/Pointer --> D;
    D -- Raw User Data/Pointer --> E;
    E -- Structured Processed Data (Analyzed Text, Topics, Entities, Timestamps) --> F;
    F -- Processed Data --> G;
    G -- Trained Model Parameters/State --> F;
    F -- Context/Retrieval Data --> H;

    %% Styling
    classDef external fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class A external;
    classDef service fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class B,D,E,G,H service;
    classDef storage fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class C,F storage;

```

### 3.2. User Interaction Data Flow (Covered in Workflow 2.4 Diagram)

*   **Input Data:** User text/voice input captured by Frontend, sent to Backend, routed to Interaction Service, converted to text (if voice), sent to AI Twin Engine.
*   **Context Data:** AI Twin Engine retrieves relevant processed data from Data Storage (e.g., user's past posts on a topic, historical conversation context) to inform its response.
*   **Output Data:** AI Twin Engine generates text response, sent back through Interaction Service (TTS if voice), Backend, and displayed/played by the Frontend.
*   **State Data:** Conversation history and twin's internal state might be updated in Data Storage during the interaction.

### 3.3. User and Subscription Data Flow

*   User registration data, profile information, and subscription details are captured by the Frontend and stored/managed by the Backend, typically persisting in the main Data Storage (Database).

## 4. Error Handling

Robust error handling is crucial for a reliable SaaS.

*   **Facebook API Errors:**
    *   Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors.
    *   Handle specific errors like revoked permissions (notify user, guide re-connection).
    *   Handle rate limiting (implement delays, notify user if import is slow).
*   **Data Import/Processing Errors:**
    *   Use queues for decoupling and retries on processing failures.
    *   Log detailed errors for specific data items that fail processing.
    *   Notify the user if a significant portion or the entire import fails.
    *   Implement idempotency for data processing steps to avoid duplicates on retries.
*   **AI Model Training/Inference Errors:**
    *   Handle out-of-memory errors or processing timeouts (log, potentially restart process, notify user of delay).
    *   If inference fails during interaction, provide a graceful fallback response ("I'm having trouble responding right now, please try again") and log the error.
    *   Implement monitoring for model performance and error rates.
*   **Database Errors:**
    *   Implement connection pooling and retry logic for transient DB errors.
    *   Handle unique constraint violations or data integrity issues with appropriate logging and user feedback where necessary.
*   **Service Communication Errors:**
    *   Use standard patterns like circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures between services (Backend, Data Processing, AI Engine, etc.).
    *   Implement timeouts for service calls.
    *   Utilize centralized logging and monitoring to detect and diagnose issues across services.
*   **User Input Errors:**
    *   Handle potential STT/TTS failures gracefully (e.g., display a text transcript even if audio fails, provide text input fallback).
    *   Log invalid input formats or excessive request rates (potential abuse).

## 5. Security Flows

Securing user data, especially sensitive Facebook information, is paramount.

### 5.1. User Authentication (Critical Flow)

Ensures only legitimate users can access their account and twin.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B{Frontend (Login/Signup)};
    B --> C[Submit Credentials/Social Login Request];
    C --> D[Frontend Sends Request to Backend Authentication Endpoint];
    D --> E[Backend Forwards Request to Authentication Service];
    E --> F{Authentication Service (Verify Credentials/Social Token)};
    F --> G{Authentication Database};
    G --> F;
    F --> H[Authentication Service Returns Token/Session ID];
    H --> I[Backend Sends Token/Session ID to Frontend];
    I --> J[Frontend Stores Token/Session ID (e.g., Local Storage, Cookie)];
    J --> K[Frontend Includes Token/Session ID in Subsequent API Requests];
    K --> L[Backend Validates Token/Session ID for Authorized Access];

    %% Styling
    classDef user fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class A user;
    classDef internal fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class B,C,D,I,J,K,L internal;
    classDef service fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class E,F,H service;
     classDef storage fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class G storage;
```

### 5.2. Facebook OAuth 2.0 Flow (Covered in Workflow 2.2 Diagram)

This is the standard, secure way to get permission to access Facebook data without handling the user's password. Key security points:

*   The user authenticates *directly* with Facebook, not our application.
*   We receive an authorization code, which is exchanged server-side for an access token.
*   The access token grants limited, revocable permission according to the scopes requested (e.g., `user_posts`, `user_photos`).
*   Access tokens should be stored securely server-side and handled with care (refreshing, revoking).

### 5.3. Data Security (At Rest and In Transit)

*   **Encryption in Transit:** All communication between Frontend, Backend, and internal services should use TLS/SSL. Communication with Facebook API is also over HTTPS.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive user data, especially raw or processed Facebook data and potentially AI model parameters, should be encrypted when stored in the Database and Object Storage.
*   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control) on data storage and internal services to ensure only authorized parts of the system can access specific types of user data. User data should be logically separated or siloed where possible.

### 5.4. Secure Handling of AI Models

*   Trained models derived from user data contain sensitive information implicitly. Store these models/parameters securely, potentially encrypted.
*   Ensure the AI Twin Engine runs in a secure environment with restricted access.

### 5.5. Input Validation and Sanitization

*   Validate and sanitize all user input (chat messages, profile updates) and data received from external sources (Facebook API) to prevent injection attacks or malformed data issues.

This document provides a foundational overview of the system flows. Detailed design specifications would expand upon each of these sections with specific technologies, API contracts, and infrastructure details.
