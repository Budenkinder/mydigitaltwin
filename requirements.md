# Requirements Document: AI Digital Twin SaaS

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 2, 2025

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:**
To develop a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that leverages Artificial Intelligence to create a personalized "digital twin" of a user based on their historical data from Facebook. The primary interaction mechanism will allow the user to engage in natural language conversations (text and voice) with their AI twin.

**Goals:**
1.  Successfully integrate with the Facebook Graph API to securely import user-approved data.
2.  Develop an AI model capable of processing diverse Facebook data (posts, comments, likes, etc.) to synthesize a unique personality, knowledge base, and conversational style reflective of the user.
3.  Provide a user-friendly interface for users to create, interact with, and manage their digital twin.
4.  Implement robust security and privacy measures to protect sensitive user data.
5.  Establish a scalable and reliable SaaS infrastructure.
6.  Implement a subscription model for revenue generation.

**Target Users:**
Individuals who are active on Facebook and are interested in self-exploration, digital identity, or novel forms of AI interaction. This includes users curious about how their online persona translates into an AI, or those seeking a unique conversational experience.

## 4. Dependencies and Constraints

**Dependencies:**
*   **Facebook Graph API:** Essential for data import. Changes or restrictions by Facebook could severely impact core functionality.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure Provider:** Relies on the chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) for hosting, computing resources (especially GPUs for AI), and storage.
*   **AI Model/Framework:** Dependent on the capabilities and licensing of the underlying AI technology (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, internal development).
*   **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech APIs:** Relies on external services for voice interaction features (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Polly).
*   **Payment Gateway Provider:** Dependent on services like Stripe or PayPal for subscription processing.
*   **Third-Party Authentication Providers:** If using Google, etc., for sign-up.

**Constraints:**
*   **Facebook API Limitations:** Subject to rate limits, data field availability, and policy changes imposed by Facebook. Not all Facebook data might be accessible or usable.
*   **AI Model Limitations:** The accuracy and naturalness of the AI twin's personality and responses are limited by the capabilities of the chosen AI model and the quality/volume of the user's Facebook data. Potential for inaccuracies or "hallucinations."
*   **Data Volume:** Processing extremely large Facebook datasets for twin creation might pose technical challenges or increase processing time and cost.
*   **Regulatory Environment:** Must operate within the bounds of global data privacy laws, which are constantly evolving.
*   **Computational Cost:** Training and running sophisticated AI models can be expensive, impacting profitability and potentially limiting features on lower subscription tiers.
