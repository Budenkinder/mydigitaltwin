**1. Document Header**

*   **Product Name:** PersonaMirror (Example Name)
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** June 2, 2025
*   **Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]

**2. Executive Summary**

PersonaMirror is a subscription-based SaaS application that empowers individuals to gain unique insights into their past selves by creating an interactive AI digital twin based on their personal Facebook data. By securely importing a user's historical posts, comments, and likes, the platform trains a sophisticated AI model designed to mimic their past communication style, perspectives, and interests as expressed on the platform. Subscribers can then engage in private text conversations with this AI twin, offering a novel method for self-reflection, journaling, memory recall, and understanding personal evolution over time. The product prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring user data is handled responsibly and solely used for creating and interacting with the user's own twin.

**3. Product Vision**

*   **Purpose:** To provide individuals with an innovative tool for deep self-reflection and personal history exploration by transforming their digital footprint into an interactive, conversational AI twin. We aim to make revisiting past thoughts and feelings an engaging and insightful experience, fostering a deeper understanding of personal growth and change.
*   **Users:** The primary users are individuals who are active or have a significant history on Facebook and are interested in self-discovery, journaling, personal archiving, psychology, or simply curious about interacting with a representation of their past self. They are likely privacy-conscious and value secure handling of their personal data.
*   **Business Goals:**
    *   Achieve a sustainable revenue stream through a tiered subscription model.
    *   Acquire a critical mass of initial subscribers.
    *   Establish a reputation for secure and privacy-focused handling of sensitive personal data.
    *   Gather user feedback to refine the AI model's accuracy and conversational quality.
    *   Explore future expansion opportunities (e.g., integrating other data sources, advanced analytical features).

**4. User Personas**

    *   **Background:** Age 35, Marketing Manager. Enjoys journaling and personal development. Has been active on Facebook for over 10 years, using it as a mix of personal diary and social connection. Concerned about how she has changed over time.
    *   **Goals:** Understand her past thought processes, see patterns in her interests and feelings over the years, gain new perspectives on old events, use the twin as a unique form of journaling.
    *   **Pain Points:** Traditional journaling is manual and time-consuming. Scrolling through old Facebook posts is tedious and lacks interactive depth. Wants a more engaging way to connect with her past self. Highly values privacy.
    *   **Why PersonaMirror:** Offers an effortless way to bring her digital history to life and interact with her past thoughts dynamically.

*   **Persona Name:** Digital Archivist David
    *   **Background:** Age 50, Freelance Writer. Values preserving personal history and digital memories. Has a vast amount of data on Facebook spanning 15+ years. Intrigued by AI and its potential for personal use.
    *   **Goals:** Create a living, interactive archive of his digital life on Facebook. Be able to "chat" with his past self about specific periods or topics. Ensure his digital legacy is preserved in a unique, accessible format.
    *   **Pain Points:** Facebook's own archiving tools are static and difficult to navigate for insight. Worries about the longevity and accessibility of his data on third-party platforms. Finds it hard to recall specifics from years ago.

**6. Technical Requirements**

*   **API Integrations:**
    *   **Facebook Graph API:** Required for OAuth authentication and securely retrieving user data (posts, comments, likes). Must adhere to Facebook's API terms of service and permission requirements.
    *   **Payment Gateway API:** Integration with a chosen provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for handling subscriptions, payments, and billing information securely. Must be PCI compliant.
    *   **AI Model Hosting/Inference API:** Depending on implementation, potentially integrate with a cloud AI service (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, or a hosted open-source model like Llama2/Mistral) for model training and conversational inference. Requires secure API key management and handling.
    *   **Cloud Storage API:** For storing raw and processed Facebook data securely (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).

*   **Data Storage Requirements:**
    *   **Database:**
        *   User accounts (hashed passwords, email, profile info).
        *   Subscription status and billing history.
        *   Facebook account connection details (securely encrypted access tokens).
        *   Chat history (linked to user and twin model version).
    *   **Blob Storage:**
        *   Raw Facebook data dump (if stored).
        *   Processed Facebook text data used for training.
        *   Trained AI models for each user (or pointers to models if shared infrastructure).
    *   **Security:** All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL). Access control must be strictly implemented. User data must be logically separated.
    *   **Privacy:** Design must ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Clear data retention and deletion policies are needed. User data must *only* be used for the explicit purpose of creating their twin and facilitating their interaction.

*   **AI Model Requirements:**
    *   The core AI model needs to be capable of conversational interaction.
    *   It must be fine-tuned or prompted effectively using the user's text data to adopt their style and reference their historical context.
    *   Safety measures must be implemented to prevent the model from generating harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content, even if present in the user's historical data.
    *   Considerations for model scalability and inference cost are crucial.

*   **Scalability:** The architecture should be designed to handle increasing numbers of users and the associated data storage and processing requirements for training and inference.

*   **Security:** Robust security measures are paramount, including secure authentication, authorization, data encryption, regular security audits, and vulnerability patching.

*   **Infrastructure:** Requires cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for hosting the application, database, storage, and potentially AI model hosting.
